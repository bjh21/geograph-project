# data import 

scripts/import-250k-gaz.php
... imports the file from the OS, into our table, trying to maintain the primary key
	(NOTE: we have since added more columns to our table, so on reimport, will need to run those other steps see os_gaz_250_new.txt )

scripts/import_csv.php
... general CSV import to database table script. But has particular support for WKT (from qGIS) column, including splitting MULTIPOLYGON

scripts/import_features.php
... coplies features from a sepereate table into feature_item

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# finding the area for each point

scripts/spatial_join.php
... fills a column in a POINTS table listing what AREA the point is within from another table

scripts/spatial_join2.php
... more effient version of spatial_join by looping over each area (rather than loopping over each point!) 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# find nearby images to a point

scripts/process_imagesperfeature.php
... for each row in 'feature_item' tries to find the nearest image. might work for other tables, but designef for that table

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# count points in an area (ok for small areas)

scripts/process_imagesperbound.php
... tries to count images within a boundary for each row in feature_item (updates the bound_images column and more)

scripts/process_imagesperbound-test.php
... an attempt a making a more generic function, to work on any table that has bound_images

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# count points in an area (optimzed for large areas like counties) 

scripts/create_hectad_boundary.php
... creates a table with spatial column of hectad boundaries - use this to create the table needed by create_hectad_table.php

scripts/create_hectad_table.php
... creates _hectad table, to split large area boundaries into more manageable parts. even with spatial index, 'complex geometry is slow to process' 
    so a 'per hectad' boundary is a lot less complex

scripts/process_imagesperhectadbound.php
... loops though ALL _hectad tables, and updates the 'bound_images' column
