<h3>Tips for selecting your pictures</h3>

<p>Many contributors have thousands of pictures on site, and you may be a bit bewildered at
knowing where to start to find a suitable selection.

<p>Here is one suggestion that you could use. It allows you to find pictures that site visitors
have given positive ratings to ("score"), which you may like to use as a starting point.

<a href="https://www.geograph.org.uk/browser/redirect.php?mine&display=group&group=monthname&n=6&gorder=alpha%20asc&sort=score">
https://www.geograph.org.uk/browser/redirect.php?mine&display=group&group=monthname&n=6&gorder=alpha%20asc&sort=score</a>

<p>This will open a page in the Geograph internal browser showing the top six rated images
for each month-name covering your entire portfolio.

<p>You can narrow down the range of images by using the sidebar on the left, e.g. by selecting
a single year, area, grid square, etc. For more information on the browser sidebar, see
<a href="ttps://www.geograph.org.uk/article/Attribute-Sidebars-in-Browser">

<p>You can expand the month group by clicking the blue month
name. Adjust the display using the &#39;Mode&#39; drop-down top-
right of the page as required. To return to monthly grouping,
select &#39;Grouped&#39;.

<p>To select an image, click on it to open it in the browser, and click &#39;Mark&#39; above the top right
hand corner of the image. Then click &#39;Close&#39; above the image to return to the normal
browser display.

<h3>Marked Images</h3>

<p>Whichever way you use to select pictures, the 'Mark' facility is the best way of temporarily storing your choice. All your 
currently 'Marked' images can be displayed by selecting 'Marked Images' on the main menu.

<p>For the Calendar it is probably sensible to mark a short list of maybe 25-30 images from which to make your final choice. 
Remember that you cannot run multiple marked lists, so if you are likely to want to mark images for a different purpose while 
you are making up your mind on your calendar selection, you will need to save your intermediate selection as a search, which 
can then be retrieved at any time. Any display (e.g. '. . . + links') which shows 'mark' or 'marked' against images displays 
the following options somewhere on the page. 

<p>'View as Search Results' creates a unique search. If you want to add to this 
selection at a later stage, when the selected images are no longer marked, open that search (from 'My recent searches' on the 
main 'Search' page) and 'Mark all images on this page'. You can mark new images to add to your selection, and repeat the above 
stages as required.

<p>Once you have created your shortlist of 'marked' images, open the 'Marked Images' page. Click 'Unmark all on this page', then 
select the 12/13 images that you wish to include in the calendar. Note that for ease of creating the calendar, the images 
should be selected in the order in which they will appear in the calendar, as set out in the main calendar instructions.

<h3>High Resolution Images</h3>

<p>If you know you will need to add high resolution images, it is probably sensible to adopt the following procedure, before 
you add any of them to the calendar.

<p>1. Create a new folder on your computer for your calendar high-res images.

<p>2. Identify which of the images you have selected need a high resolution version, and locate the originals on your computer.

<p>3. Copy these originals into the new folder, and make any necessary edits (crop/tilt/exposure, etc) to match the version on 
Geograph as closely as possible.

<p>Having all your high resolution images in one folder will make the job of adding them within the calendar creation process 
much more straightforward. (The procedure also ensures that you avoid making unwanted changes to your original images!)
