<h2>Your personalised Geograph Calendar</h2>

<div class="helptext">

<h3>How to order your Calendars</h3>

<p>This provides the initial link to create a new Calendar</p>


<p>Once you have created one or more selections
of images in Steps 1 and 2, the page will show
links showing the status of each selection
which you can then access either to edit the
selection or to confirm the order.

<h3>Step 1</h3>

<a href="./start.php">/calendar/start.php</a>

<p>You are recommended to set up your selection of images in a separate window, and to add
images in the order you wish them to appear in your calendar. Please note that there is no
straightforward way of removing an image from your selection, so you are advised to
finalise your choice of images before transferring your selection to this page.

<p>There are a variety of ways in which you can add the image IDs, as described on the page.
Dragging a thumbnail (or the photo from its main page) from any Geograph page will
cause the photo ID to be added to the list in the selection box. Remember that if you use
the &#39;Marked List&#39; option, the images will appear in the order in which you marked them,
although you will be able to change the order in Step 2 if you wish.

<p>Thumbnails of the selected images are displayed alongside the selection box as they are
added.

<p>You must have either 12 or 13 images selected before you can move to Step 2. The &#39;Add . .
images&#39; button at the bottom shows how many images are selected but is not active if fewer
or more images are listed.

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>This page displays the set of images in the order in which they will appear in the calendar,
together with the title, location, photographer and date taken details. The larger of the two
thumbnails gives an indication of how the image will fit on the calendar page. The size of
the image and the approximate dpi (&#39;dots per inch&#39; . an indication of the print quality) is
also shown. If this shows in red you are strongly recommended to add a higher resolution
image. You should also consider doing so if the value is under 200.

<p>Adding a high resolution image uses exactly the same procedure as adding a larger size to a
photo page, except that it is only attached to the calendar, not to the original photo page.
The two thumbnails displayed provide a double-check that the correct image has been
added; the small thumbnail links directly to the photo page

<p>The &#39;Move Up&#39; and &#39;Move Down&#39; buttons allow you to adjust the sequence of images.

<p>At this stage if you are not entirely satisfied with your selection you have the opportunity 
to upload a different image from the one chosen by clicking the 'Replace Image' button and 
following the instructions.

<p>The title displayed by default is the title on the normal photo page, but you can create any
text you wish, up to a maximum of 120 characters. There is a countdown to show you how
much space you have left.

<p>The place displayed by default is the location shown on the normal photo page. This is taken from a gazetteer which occasionally provides an 'incorrect' location, so this field is also editable, up to a maximum of 60 characters..

<p>If you use the option to select only 12 images, you will see a option alongside the images 
allowing you to select one as the cover image. <br>

<p>Or if you now decide that you want an additional image for the cover, you can add this by clicking the 
'Specify Cover Image' button near the top of the page.<br>

<p>Please note that the details of the cover image do appear on the back cover of the calendar,
so if you choose 13 images, the cover is not &#39;anonymous&#39;.

<h3>Step 3</h3>

<p>This is the final order page. It displays thumbnails of your selected images, with the cover 
image separate at the top. If satisfied, fill in the necessary details at the bottom of the 
page and proceed to payment.

<p>You will need to complete a separate order for each selection you make*. These will be 
combined for dispatch to a single delivery address.
